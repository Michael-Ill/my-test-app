# This is my NHL API App where I tinker around with the NHL stats API. 

---

**This app is intended to just be a React practice project for API calls, specifically NHL ones**

### Features
1. List of Teams
2. All 32 Rosters
3. Bios for each player with headshots
4. More to come!

I hope to be able to turn this into a full fledged React app with any and all NHL stats at the user's fingertips, much like the official NHL website but with my own flair!
